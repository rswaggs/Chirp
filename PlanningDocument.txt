Development plan:
1. Decide between PostgreSQL and MySQL
	- Work on data models and JPA queries that I may use
2. Work on view pages with barebones content
3. React
	- Start a react project and make a few file and components on what I imagine to 	work out well
4. Work on the controller
5. User REST APIs to pass data to the react components.
6. Work on ensuring data security and proper login checks.
6. Hopefully all of that wasn't too difficult. Now a few JUnit tests.
7. Maybe simple tests with something like Selenium.
8. Deploy JAR file on AWS with the help of more tutorials.

    Email varchar(50) NOT NULL,
    Username varchar(50) NOT NULL,
    Password varchar(50) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (PersonID)
);

// Save file on disk and maintain reference
CREATE TABLE AudioFiles (
    AudioID int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    FilePath varchar(50) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (AudioID)
);

// Index for faster reading later
CREATE TABLE Favourites (
    PersonID int,
    AudioID int,
    CONSTRAINT Favourite PRIMARY KEY (PersonID, AutoID),
    FOREIGN KEY (PersonID) REFERENCES Users(PersonID),
    FOREIGN KEY (AudioID) REFERENCES AudioFiles(AudioID)
);
