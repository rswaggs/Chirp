Development plan:
1. Decide between PostgreSQL and MySQL (recreate Maven file to reduce dependencies)
	- Maven (DevTools, Lombok, Web, Rest Repositories, Thymeleaf, Security, JPA, (MySQL or PostgreSQL, maybe H2 in-memory database for faster development and testing)
	- Work on data models and JPA queries that I may use
2. Work on view pages with barebones content
3. React
	- Start a react project and make a few file and components on what I imagine to 	work out well
4. Work on the controller
5. User REST APIs to pass data to the react components.
6. Work on ensuring data security and proper login checks.
6. Hopefully all of that wasn't too difficult. Now a few JUnit tests.
7. Maybe simple tests with something like Selenium.
8. Deploy JAR file on AWS with the help of more tutorials.
