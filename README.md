This is a small application I intend to work on time-to-time when I get tired of applying
for jobs for the day.

The main goal of of the project is to learn and demostrate my understanding of React, as well as Java's Spring Boot framework. 
I want to try learning other things like JUnit and Docker where I can.


For the project, there will be a login, profile, and feed pages. I'll create documentation as I go along.
