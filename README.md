This is a small application I intend to work on time-to-time when I get bored/tired of applying
for jobs for the day.

The main goal of of the project is to learn and demostrate my understanding of either React
or AngularJS (most likely AngularJS if it's suitable), as well as Java's Spring framework. 
I want to try learning other things like JUnit and Docker where I can.


For the project, basically there will be a login, profile, feed pages.
